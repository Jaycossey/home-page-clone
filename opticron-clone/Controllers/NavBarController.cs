    // Follow steps 3 to 5 specifically https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-mvc-app/adding-controller?view=aspnetcore-8.0&tabs=visual-studio

    // Models are classes which represent the data 
    // Views are the components (think react)
    // Controllers handle browser requests and retrieve the model data and return a response
    // these are how the home page returns to the layout cshtml

    // In this case so far, I have created a home page view and the controller already existed,
    // I want to compartmentalise this in a specific way
    // one for the Featured section
    // one for offers and the other 
    // for catagories

    // The data should be in 3 tables, one for each

    // Can expand upon this to include the site details as well (navbar, contact, placeholders etc)

    // I can seed the data this way, and add the database AFTER the setup is completed. 

    // Note for anyone reading this: the above is my thought process and helping me understand how ASP.NET works with
    // C# and SQL for web development. I have currently hardcoded all text, and am more comfortable with the frameworks
    // and setting myself up to understand the backend connections easier than if I had done the backend first. Takes longer
    // but helps me understand things better
