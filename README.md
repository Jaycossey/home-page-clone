# Opticron clone (WIP)

An ASP.NET MVC C# clone of a website, utilising an integrated and seeded SQL database. This project was created to test and expand my skillset, being presented with the challenge has been a wonderous journey so far and has pushed me to embrace new skills. Having previously only worked alongside the MERN stack (and prior, some vanilla C), learning new languages and frameworks has been an incredibly useful experience. 

While still currently a work in progress, I have so far:

- Setup VSCode environment to work with C# and ASP.NET MVC on a familiar platform after transitioning to Linux
- Handled creating a server with SQL Server
- Implemented the Front End Home page clone utilizing cshtml
- Created Routers (Controllers) for the views
- Created basic Models for data handling and creation
- Utilized the Foundation Framework to implement responsive design
- Added custom classes with vanilla CSS
- Gained insight into how to implement the database for the text content of the site
