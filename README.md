# Opticron clone

An ASP.NET MVC C# clone of a home page, utilising an integrated and seeded SQL database. This project was created to test and expand my skillset, being presented with the challenge has been a wonderous journey so far and has pushed me to embrace new skills. Having previously only worked alongside the MERN stack (and prior, some vanilla C), learning new languages and frameworks has been an incredibly eye opening experience.

To complete the task, I accomplished the following:

- Setup VSCode environment to work with C# and ASP.NET MVC on a familiar platform after transitioning to Linux
- Handled creating a server with SQL Server
- Implemented the Front End Home page clone utilizing cshtml
- Created Routers (Controllers) for the views
- Created basic Models for data handling and creation
- Utilized the Foundation Framework to implement responsive design
- Added custom classes with vanilla CSS
- Gained insight into how to implement the database for the text content of the site
- Added JS (jQuery) libraries to handle a carousel animation

### Known issues / areas for improvement

- Codebase does not entirely follow best practices, will need cleanup
- Routing for controllers could do with a cleanup
- Deployment issues, currently working on a fix

### Overall personal experience

Overall I thoroughly enjoyed this project, taking on a new learning experience has been extremely valuable and has enabled me to take on a new challenge and learn more frameworks and work with strongly typed languages. I will enjoy working with ASP.NET and C# in the future and look forward to future projects with these technologies!
